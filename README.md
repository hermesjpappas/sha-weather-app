## It gets you the weather.
<p>Fancy, right?</p>

<p>This is an exercise from Social Hackers Academy where I learned about making API calls and used promises with vanilla JavaScript.</p>

## Instructions:
<p>Type in the city you want to find or the city and its country code (US, GR, etc) and press Enter or click/tap on the Get Weather button.</p>

## Issues / TO-DO:
<p>Tried to think of a city name with three separate words but couldn't think of one so for the time being this works for two-word cities such as "San Antonio", "Los Angeles", etc.</p>
